# Project Vision

RedDrop is a mobile-first platform that connects blood donors with patients in need across Bangladesh. It aims to simplify emergency blood finding using verified donors, hospital registration, and real-time notifications. The platform will be bilingual and include donor cool-down timers, rewards, and blood stock monitoring in future versions.
